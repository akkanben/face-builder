# Face Builder

I designed this app to test an idea about giving color to a black and white image. While looking into CSS color filters I realized that the sepia filter gives a white image some color. Using sepia in conjunction with other filter properties many different colors can be achieved.

While researching the sepia filter I came across another project aimed at creating a conversion tool. This gave me the idea to add the invert slider.
